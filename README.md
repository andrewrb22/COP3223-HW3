## Write  a program that asks the user to enter three integers. A menu is displayed to allow the following options:
### A – Print the lowest number entered 
###  B -  Print the highest number entered 
### C -  Print whether the first number entered is an even or an odd number 
 ### D – print the division of third number entered by the sum of the first two numbers entered

### Note well that your code should test for division by zero and your code should demonstrate the use of the switch structure.
